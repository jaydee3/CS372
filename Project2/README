Files:
	ftserver.c - C code of FTP server
	ftclient.py - Python code for the FTP client
	makefile - makefile for ftserver.c

Compilation:
	Place makefile and ftserver.c in the same directory and enter "make" on the command line to create ftserver executable

Instructions:

	1. Start ftserver by entering "ftserver [port]" on the command line
		- [port] is a valid numerical port number
	2. Send request to ftserver from chatserve.py by entering: 
		-"python3 ftclient.py [server name] [server port] -l [data port]" to get the directory listing from ftserver
		-"python3 ftclient.py [server name] [server port] -g [file name] [data port]" to transfer a file from ftserver's directory
			- [server name] is the name of the server the ftserver is running on (flip1, flip2, or flip3)
			- [server port] is the port ftserver is running on
			- [data port] is the port that will be used to transfer the requested data over
			- [file name] is a valid file name in ftserver's directory
	3. The ftserver program be terminated at anytime by pressing CTRL+C

Note:
	These files were developed on flip 2 and flip3, and tested on flip1, flip2, and flip3
	The ftserver executable and ftclient.py files can be placed in the same or separate folders.
	If the client is trying to save a file that already exists in its folder, it will still copy the file, but append a number at the end of the file name
